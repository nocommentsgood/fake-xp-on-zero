# Fake Xp On Zero
This plugin displays fake xp drops when hitting a hitsplat with a value of 0. For the best experience, disable other fake xp drop plugins, such as the XP Drop plugin included in Runelite.

# Features
Currently this only works with melee, range, and magic when not using a staff with built-in auto attacks (such as trident of the swamp, Iban's staff, etc.).

# To do
Get powered staves to work correctly

Get the fake xp drop to happen on the correct tick. Currently, it gives a drop one tick behind.
